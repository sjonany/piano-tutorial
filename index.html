      <p class="section-content">
        This is a short tutorial on how you can create delicious arpeggio covers for your favorite songs.
        I originally wrote this for my brother and he likes anime music, so I'm using that as the recurring song :D
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here's the end result:

      <p class="section-header">Level 1. 1-5-1</p>
      <p class="section-content">
        A basic starting pattern is to play the first (also known as root) and fifth note of the scale of the chord you are playing.
        For example, for the chord C, the corresponding scale is C major, and the first note is C, third note is E, and fifth note is G.
      </p>
      <p class="section-header">Sheet</p>
      <p class="section-content">
        Take a listen here. Note how the left hand only plays 3 quarter notes then pauses for each chord.
        Do you see that all the left hand is doing is just the 1-5-1 pattern?

      <p class="section-content">The lessons build up on top of each other, so it's important to master each before going to the next. Here are some suggested practice goals:</p>
      <p class="section-content"><span class="practice-header">1. [Left]</span> Practice just the left hand in isolation. Make sure you know the 1's and 5's of each chord.</p>
      <p class="section-content"><span class="practice-header">2. [Left and right]</span> Practice with the right hand. Pay attention to which left and right hand notes have to be played at the same time.</p>
      <p class="section-content"><span class="practice-header">3. [In tempo]</span> Practice against the musescore recording, and make sure you can follow the same tempo without any mistakes.
        In the "Sheet" section, the musescore widget allows looping. Set "end measure" to 4.</p>
      <p class="section-content"><span class="practice-header">4. [Another song]</span> Repeat the above to another song.
        Pick one song that you know the chords of. If you don't, you can use
        <a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/misc-computer-games/final-fantasy-x-to-zanarkand-chords-1505174">
          ultimate guitar</a>
        and see if you can play the song using this pattern.

        We can make our playing be more continuous by also descending after we reach the highest note. The pattern is now 1515.

        Take a listen here. Note how we play the fifth note of each scale instead of resting.

        Let's play twice as many notes.
        If we just use 1 and 5, we will have to span a lot of octaves, so let's also add the third of each scale.
        We'll use the pattern 15135131. Note how there are 8 notes to fill each bar.

        WARNING: There is a huge jump in difficulty.
        If this is your first time, I recommend starting with a slow tempo (e.g. 30 BPM, so you play 1 note per second), and each day increasing by 10 BPM.</p>

    <p class="section-header"> Level 5. Rhythm gaps</p>
    <p class="section-content">
      You can leave out some notes in your left hand if your right hand is playing a melody, and your playing will still sound continuous.
      Heck, you can even play different patterns each time! 
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Sheet</p>
    <p class="section-content">
      Note how leaving some space on the arpeggio when the right hand is playing can make the piece sound more interesting.
      You still want to play the bass note regardless of the right hand to establish the chord though.

      Sketch up a new pattern, while keeping the same rhtyhmic gaps. Practice that.

      To be able to improvise, you must instinctively be able to identify the notes of the chords.
      One way to get better at this is to practice chord inversions -- go find youtube tutorials on "chord inversions" and practice them first as a precursor step if you haven't done this before.
